My computer science NEA project
A Local-Multiplayer “Texas Hold ‘Em Poker” Game for New Players

This project allows two players to play Texas Hold 'Em against each other.
Main features:
 - uses Monte Carlo simulations to help new players understand the probability of their hand being a winning hand.
 - interactive GUI with fold, all-in, and call buttons and raise text box for player actions
 - background with helpful poker hand rankings information
 - local multiplayer capabilities -- swaps turns between players

The way the two player system has been implemented means that either player can see both player's hands at the same time. This is intentional to help players understand the value of their cards weighed up against enemy hands.
